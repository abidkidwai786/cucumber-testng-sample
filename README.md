# Run Selenium Tests With Cucumber On LambdaTest



## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Selenium automation testing with Cucumber, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment** i.e. **JDK 8** or higher. We recommend using the **<jdk11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven**. It can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=cucumber-testng-sample) or by your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=cucumber-testng-sample).

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
* For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test

>**Test Scenario**: Here is the sample feature file for Cucumber that shows a scenario to test a sample to-do list app by marking couple items as done, adding a new item to the list and finally displaying the count of pending items as output.


```bash
Feature: Do native app automation

Scenario: Proverbial App scenario

Given user is on the App home page
When click on color element
Then click on geolocation element and navigate back
Then click on text element
Then click on notification element
Then click on toast element
```


### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step 3:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capability = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capability.setCapability(CapabilityType.BROWSER_NAME, browser);
            capability.setCapability(CapabilityType.VERSION,version);
            capability.setCapability(CapabilityType.PLATFORM, platform);
            capability.setCapability("build", "Your Build Name");
```

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of [Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=cucumber-testng-sample).


### Executing The Test

**Step 4:** Executing single and parallel test:

mvn test -D suite=single.xml 

mvn test -D suite=parallel.xml 


Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on LambdaTest Automation Dashboard. LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with LambdaTest Selenium grid using LambdaTest Tunnel. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using tunnel and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are live.

Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=cucumber-testng-sample) for more information.

Here‚Äôs how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for macOS](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)


Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
LT -user {user‚Äôs login email} -key {user‚Äôs access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:

```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();        
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```
